OpenAurora

This is an open-source remake of the existing game Aurora 4x created by Steve Walmsley, which in turn was inspired by the board game Starfire by Stephen V. Cole.

It is in no way associated with or endorsed by Aurora 4x, Starfire, or Aurora Energy Research and is released as-is, both free as in beer (gratis) and free as in speech (libre).
