Outstanding components for game flow:
	Game state 
		List of pieces
			Position
			player
			Name?
			type (planet or ship for now)
				Ships have speed
				Ships have detection range
					Future: different sensor packages have different ranges
					Future: sensor package has different ranges for different targets
				Ships have movement plans (list of waypoints?)
					Throws an exception when plan ends?
					Near future: tool for constructing waypoints
					Future: AI can make decisions at plan end
	State incrementer
		Variable size time increments
		Game pauses when ships enter each other's detection radii
	State renderer
		Board is done
		Need some way to display messages.
	Message queue
		Timestamp
	placeholder AI
	Player orders
	End turn functionality
